# Airport-Database-project

This docx file is the final version of a project I made for our Database course.

The project involved designing a relational database from scratch then implimenting the database and populating it.

The project also includes some queries at the end.

All the SQL statements are in the report file.

The insert statements were generated using a python script (the database script repository).
