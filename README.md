# Airport-Database-project

This pdf file is the final version of a project I made for my Database course.\n

The project involved designing a relational database from scratch then implimenting the database and populating it.

The project also includes some queries at the end.

All the SQL statements are in the pdf file.

The insert statements were generated using a python script (the database script repository).
